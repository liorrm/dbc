      <span id="blogSubTitle">A New Look at Pedagogy</span>
      <span id="date">September 18, 2014</span>

<span class="post">I've said it before and I will say it again and again: I believe wholeheartedly that the firmly ensconced system of education in the United States, particularly higher education, is an antiquated system that, although it has evolved some over the years, has not evolved at the same rate that society has. These differing rates of change have led to a disconnect between academia and the real world. Dev Bootcamp promises to bridge that gap and be a new, fresh, completely revolutionary form of education that is at the vanguard of pedagogy. With an emphasis on emotional intelligence and people skills, DBC's curriculum might have traditional thinkers raising their eyebrows. Indeed, learning how to code is only one piece of the puzzle of what it means to be a DBC student. As it should be. Having left academia disenchanted with the passive learning environment it created, I am hungry for the new, active, get-your-hands-dirty environment DBC will provide. It's been such a wonderful thing to realize that being a programmer takes a lot more emotional and interpersonal skills than it does raw analytical skills, and that all these skills *can* be cultivated; I'd always thought that coding was entirely analytical and that I'd have no chance because I've always been more of a people person.

Having gone through merely a week of the Phase 0 curriculum, I can say that I am left even more eager to become an integral part of this learning environment, that, as Shereef mentioned in his fireside chat, will be an act of co-creation. Yes, I will come to day one of Phase 1 with a healthy dose of nervousness, as it is a bold, completely novel, experimental experience. But I'll take risky and adventurous over safe and boring *any* day, and that's exactly why I'm here at DBC.<br> <br> <br></span>

      <span id="blogSubTitle">Programmers' Godsend</span>

<span class="post">Version control in computer programming has many benefits. For one, it basically allows the programmer to "go back in time" in that various versions of the project are saved throughout a period of time. If the programmer works on the project, but accidentally adds a bug in committing those changes, they can go back to the version of that code *before* they made that mistake, rather than trying to figure out how it was before. This saves a lot of time, panic, and effort! Version control is also essential in collaborative projects, where there is more than one programmer working on a code base. It allows the programmers to each have their own copy of the code base, and make changes to that personal copy (and test those changes to make sure they work/don't add a bug) before adding it to the master copy.

Git is software that makes version control easy. It runs in the background of any directory you decide to initialize with git. It<br>
-notices if you have made any changes to that directory, whether it be adding files or editing files,<br>
-knows exactly what those changes are, and can show you them, and<br>
-allows you to save ("commit") those changes along with a small message where you describe what changes you have made. Git then keeps a log of your commits (changes), and you can go back and see the code as it was before and after the various changes you made.

GitHub is another useful tool for programmers, especially for teams of developers. Storing your code on GitHub allows you to collaborate with people remotely, so you can theoretically work on a project with a remote team all around the world, so long as they have Internet access. While git lives locally on your computer, and is therefore useful for working on your local disk, GitHub lives on the cloud, and works in tandem with git to push your code on to GitHub, enabling other team members to see your code, and enabling *you* to make changes to the master copy of the project. GitHub also provides peace of mind, knowing that your code is stored on a remote and very reliable server; it basically acts as a backup of your code.<br> <br> <br> </span>
