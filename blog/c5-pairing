### Discuss (at least) the following in your blog post:
#### Pairing:
- What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
- Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
- Was something frustrating and difficult for you?

#### Feedback
- How did you feel when you read your feedback?
- Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
- Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to
do to improve next time you pair?
- How was it to write feedback?
- What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?

Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?



Pair-programming is a magical thing, really -- two programmers come together and achieve something they never thought possible. That's been my experience, anyway. Working with someone on a problem not only combines our brainpower, it also, in my experience, causes our individual brainpower to increase. When you find a good pairing partner, the experience is extremely enjoyable, fluid, and productive. You both play integral parts of the problem-solving process, throw around ideas, and ultimately solve the challenge in much less time (and with much less frustration) than if you were to go at it alone. The experience on the whole is very fun and rewarding. I've had multiple experiences where, upon first looking at the challenge, I feel overwhelmed, but then a mere 30 minutes to an hour later, there I am looking at the solution to a problem I barely understood an hour earlier.

The only time pairing can be frustrating is if you can't build rapport with your partner. This is rarely the case, in my experience, as I always make a point to get to know the person, at the very least on a superficial level, so that it's not like we're two robots programming together. Sometimes there are situations where your pair doesn't communicate effectively, but if you probe them with questions, you can usually get the answer or explanation you're looking for. While this type of arrangement doesn't leave you feeling excited about pairing with that person again, per se, you don't get frustrated. It's just a less than overwhelmingly positive experience. Having said that, I'm sure there have been


Feedback is at the core of Dev Bootcamp's philosophy. It is an integral part of the curriculum, and we as students are required to give feedback after each pair-programming session.
