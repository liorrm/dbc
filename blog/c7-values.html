Below is a list of some of my values with how much importance they have in my life:

Accomplishment: 4
Achievement: 4
Adventure: 5
Affection: 4
Ambition: 5
Autonomy: 5
Close relationships: 5
Compassion: 5
Competence: 5
Confidence: 5

Nature: 4
Peace: 4
Pleasure: 4
Self-reliance: 5
Self-respect: 5
Stability: 5
Tranquility: 4
Vibrancy: 4
Wisdom: 4

These are all important values in my life. The one whose importance is easy to explain is economic security, as I have not been economically stable for many years of my life and really feel its absence. I am not concerned with being wealthy, but with being able to support myself and help my family, which ties into other values such as self-reliance, stability, tranquility, money, etc.

How do I feel when I think about my values? I feel excited, reminded of what I have to live for, what I'm doing with myself. I feel motivated and remember all the things I want to do, the difference I want to make. I think these values hold the key for me to keep up my morale at DBC and to mediate stereotype threat. If I just stop for a moment and think about the big picture, I feel like I can restore my morale.
