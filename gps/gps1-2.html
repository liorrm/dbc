    <div id="question_1">
      <h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
      <p>Pair programming is a collaborative exercise where two or more people work together,
      either remotely or in person, on a coding project.
      Typically, there are two roles: driver and navigator. They will complement each other and give each other feedback during the process of programming</p>
    </div>
    <div id="question_2">
      <h2>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h2>
      <p>Pair programming gives coders the opportunity to collaborate and share ideas with other coders. It builds
       people skills, and brings in fresh perspectives, allowing programmers to come up with solutions quicker and more efficiently
       than if they were working alone. It also builds relationships between programmers, leading to a better dynamic in the workplace.
       It makes you a better learner and a team player.</p>

    <div id="driver">
      <h2>Driver</h2>
      <p>The driver is the one in control of the keyboard; he or she actually types and executes the code and makes changes to the file.
      The driver's role focuses on the specific changes being made to the code, guided by the navigator.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="navigator">
      <h2>Navigator</h2>
      <p>The navigator's role is to guide the process forward. He or she may do research,
        provide guidance, suggest alternative methodologies, and keep a broader vision of the project as a whole.</p>
